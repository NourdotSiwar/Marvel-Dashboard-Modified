# Web Development Project 6 - *Marvel-Dashboard-Modified*

Submitted by: **Nour Siwar**

This web app: **Adding multiple data visualizations such as linear, scatter, bar, and pie graphs to the dashboard view and constructing a detail view containing more info related to a given data point from Marvel API. Additionally, there are implemented dynamic links using React Router, giving each data point listed on the dashboard a unique link to a corresponding detail view.**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **The app includes at least two unique chart developed using the fetched data that tell an interesting story**
- [X] **Clicking on an item in the list view displays more details about it**
- [X] **Clicking on an item has a direct, unique link to that item's detail view page**


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] The site's customized dashboard contains more content that explains what is interesting about the data
- [X] The site allows users to toggle between different data visualizations

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

* Getting navigation bar to work where clicking on the Dashboard leads to home instead of having a side button for home
* Had major issue with ParamsUse() as the data would not load for each detail of every character.
* Had a problem with getting the names to have the link that would lead toward the detailview
* While using recharts was easy to find different types of charts, it was a bit difficult to implement all but it was entertaining as they all ended up working
